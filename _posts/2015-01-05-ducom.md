* Wrote a Java program to analyze motor primitive sequences extracted from EMG data. 

* Searched for recurring patterns and lengths of patterns in order to observe motor primitive chords.

* These chords can be linked to muscle movements, and provide insight into how the brain controls the muscular system.  


At DUCOM, I learned how to apply the programming principles that I had taught myself to actual problems. The experience also provided me with a lot of insight as to how scientific research and data analysis are executed.
