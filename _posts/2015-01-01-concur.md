During my internship with Concur, I worked on an agile team within Travel R&D. While there I created new architecture for browser testing automation for the existing Profile page using C# and Entity Framework. I also contributed to development of a new Profile page using the modern Model View Controller framework to replace the existing legacy Classic ASP project.
