As part of Drexel's HSSRI Program, I designed, wrote, and implemented an original **data analysis** algorithm (in **Java**) to find recurring motor primitive symbol patterns from EMG data. I conducted research using proprietary braided neural electrodes. At the end of the program, I presented my work at the Discovery Day 2012 research symposium.
