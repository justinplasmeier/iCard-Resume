During my internship with Concur, I contributed to development of a new profile page using the .NET MVC framework to replace the legacy page. Additionall, I developed browser testing automation using C# and Selenium WebDriver to ensure stability in production. To help with this, I designed the testing architecture around automated test generation with Perl to make writing tests effortless. I have learned a lot about software at enterprise scale. I have also been exposed to a wide range of software practices, from untangling legacy code to designing brand new microservices while committing production-ready code to both.
