At Answers, I developed novel web application features for an existing project in the **ASP.NET framework using C#, Javascript, HTML, and CSS**. For my other project, I built a **Windows Forms application** from scratch in **C#** to interface with a **SQL database** and conditionally restrict data using logical expressions based on the SQL schema. Additionally, I repaired a **C#** application to safely retry a data fetch operation and wrote a comprehensive stored procedure in **T-SQL** to automate a tedious data feed import.
